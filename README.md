# **the-olympics: Usability Testing and Iteration Report**

## **Overview**

This exercise is designed to evaluate the **usability and functionality** of a wireframe prototype through real user interaction. The goal is to gather insights into how users engage with the interface, identify pain points, and refine the prototype based on their feedback.  

Usability testing is a critical step in the **User-Centered Design (UCD)** process, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users. By observing participants as they navigate the prototype, we can detect **navigation difficulties, interaction friction, and missing features** that impact the user experience.  

This exercise consists of three main components:  
1. **Conducting usability tests** with real users.  
2. **Documenting user feedback** and identifying key usability issues.  
3. **Revising the prototype** by implementing the five most impactful improvements based on user testing results.  

At the end of this exercise, we will have a refined prototype that better aligns with user needs, improving overall usability and efficiency.

## **Objectives**

- **Evaluate the wireframe prototype** through real user interaction.  
- **Identify usability challenges** such as navigation difficulties, unclear labels, or unintuitive flows.  
- **Document insights and patterns** in user behavior.  
- **Propose five critical design improvements** to implement in the next version.  
- **Prepare structured usability test materials**, including a test script and a summary report.

## **Exercise Breakdown**

### **1. Conducting Usability Testing**
Participants will be given a scenario where they must complete a set of tasks using the wireframe prototype. Their behavior, struggles, and feedback will be observed and recorded.

- **Test Group:** Minimum of five users.  
- **Observation Criteria:**  
  - How easily users complete tasks.  
  - Points where users get confused or stuck.  
  - Verbal and non-verbal reactions.  
- **Data Collection Methods:**  
  - Screen recordings or notes on user behavior.  
  - Direct feedback from participants.  
  - Any usability issues encountered.  

### **2. Creating a Usability Test Script**
A structured usability test script must be prepared to ensure consistency across all sessions. This script should include:  

- **Greeting & onboarding paragraph** to introduce users to the test.  
- **Clear task scenario** that outlines what the user must do.  
- **Conclusion and wrap-up** to collect final thoughts and thank participants.  

### **3. Analyzing Results and Iterating the Prototype**
Once testing is complete, results must be compiled into a structured report. This report will include:  
- **Key insights from testing.**  
- **Patterns observed across multiple users.**  
- **Five key iterations to improve the design.**  
- **Potential areas for further refinement in future versions.**

## **Deliverables**

1. **Usability Test Script (PDF)**  
   - Includes onboarding message, test scenario, and closing statement.  

2. **Pictures of Ongoing Tests**  
   - Screenshots or photos of the usability test being conducted.  

3. **Usability Testing Report (PDF)**  
   - Summary of insights from user testing.  
   - Five recommended design iterations.

## **Best Practices & Tips**
- Keep the test **neutral and unbiased**â€”avoid leading users to a specific conclusion.  
- Observe **both verbal and non-verbal reactions** for deeper insights.  
- Ask **open-ended questions** like:  
- "What did you expect to happen here?"  
- "How would you describe your experience using this feature?"  
- Prioritize **the most impactful iterations** based on common user struggles.

## **Final Notes**
This exercise ensures that the product is **usable, intuitive, and efficient** before moving to the final design phase. By testing early and iterating based on user feedback, we **reduce costly design flaws** and build a product that truly meets user needs.
